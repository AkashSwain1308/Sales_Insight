# Sales_Insight
The file here is a backup for the project I completed on making a dashboard for Sales analysis

In the SQL file the database is created and saved.
SQL is also used to calculate extra columns such as profit margin, profit margin %, etc.

The SQL file is then imported into Tableau through mySQL connection
The analysis is thereafter done in Tableau to prepare the visualizations through use of functions and formulas.

The dashboard is also uploaded to the Tableau Online
